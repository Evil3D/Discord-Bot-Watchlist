# **Discord Bot Watchlist**

Hallo, this is where I'm gonna put all the bot invites I’ve collected.  
What I do is basically check the servers I’m in for unverified bots —  
if there are any, I check if I can add them to my server.  
Now I’ve got a list of **50+ working bot invites**.  
These probably won’t be checked a lot…  
**yeah no, who am I kidding — they won’t be checked at all after being added.**

## ❓ Why I Made This

I was quite bored and… I was bored.  
It's kinda fun and interesting, plus I get to see different Discord messages like:
- “This bot is private”
- “Reported for abuse”
- “Blocked due to spam”  
(especially from scammy bots)

## 📜 Bot Invite Lists

There are multiple lists — not just one massive dump.

The main list is stored as a markdown file,  
but the website pulls directly from it and formats it much cleaner.

## 🛠️ Vencord Plugin – **ListBots**

I also made a Vencord plugin for this purpose.

### 💡 What it does:
Adds a new right-click option on servers:  
**“List Bots”**  
When clicked, it opens a GUI showing all bots in the server.

🧪 Tested in big servers like Fortnite’s —  
weirdly, I had to ping a hidden bot to make the rest load (maybe due to Vencord mods).

## 🔍 Want to Chat?

There *might* be a Discord server for this 👀  
It’s not ready. Or maybe it’s hidden. 🕵️‍♂️  
You’ll find it... if you're meant to.
