# **Discord Bot Watchlist**

Hallo, this is where im gonna put all the bot invites i have collected, what i do is basically check the servers im in for unverified bots and if there are any i check if i can add them to my server, and now i have a list of over 50 working bot invites, these most likely will not be checked alot, if at all.

Idk what else to say so here's why i made this:
  I was quite bored and i was bored..
  It's kinda fun and interesting, also i get to see a bit of different messages from discord, like private access or reported for abuse, or reported for spam(from some bots, mostly scam ones) and yea!
  
Also i have different lists, so there'll be more than just 1 list of bot invites. You can visit the list either at [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evil3D/Discord-Bot-Watchlist/main/List.md) or the [Website](https://evil3d.github.io/Discord-Bot-Watchlist)
