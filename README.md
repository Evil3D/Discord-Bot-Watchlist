# **Discord Bot Watchlist**

Hallo, this is where im gonna put all the bot invites i have collected, what i do is basically check the servers im in for unverified bots and if there are any i check if i can add them to my server, and now i have a list of over 50 working bot invites, these most likely will not be checked alot, if at all.

Idk what else to say so here's why i made this:
  I was quite bored and i was bored..
  It's kinda fun and interesting, also i get to see a bit of different messages from discord, like private access or reported for abuse, or reported for spam(from some bots, mostly scam ones) and yea!
  
Also i have different lists, so there'll be more than just 1 list of bot invites. You can visit the list either at [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evil3D/Discord-Bot-Watchlist/main/List.md) or the [Website](https://evil3d.github.io/Discord-Bot-Watchlist)

Alsoooo i've made a vencord plugin for this purpose pretty much!
What it does is it adds a new button to when you right click a server, which is "List Bots", when used it'll open up a gui with all the bots in the server (i used this for the fortnite server, and i had to @ a bot that wasnt in the list for it to load all of the others, i didnt send it i js @'d it, i did have a vencord mod to be able to open it's context menu when i just click on the unsent @ which is probably why it loaded every other bot, otherwise idk why, have fun!).

The install process is either annoying/interesting or uh cool ig depends on what typa person you are.
Follow [This](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/) and when it tells u to place the file(s) in the userplugins folder, extract the ListBots folder and place it in there (not the files inside the ListBots folder but the folder with all the files), then rebuild vencord and inject it into discord so it adds the plugin and enable it and there ya go (this is all assuming you know how to build/rebuild vencord, if not follow [This](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/#building-vencord))
